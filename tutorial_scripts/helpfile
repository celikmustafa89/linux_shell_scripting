       %Z     alphabetic time zone abbreviation (e.g., EDT)

       By  default,  date  pads  numeric  fields  with  zeroes.  The following
       optional flags may follow '%':

       -      (hyphen) do not pad the field

       _      (underscore) pad with spaces

       0      (zero) pad with zeros

       ^      use upper case if possible

       #      use opposite case if possible

       After any flags comes an optional field width,  as  a  decimal  number;
       then an optional modifier, which is either E to use the locale's alter‐
       nate representations if available, or O to use the  locale's  alternate
       numeric symbols if available.

EXAMPLES
       Convert seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 UTC) to a date

              $ date --date='@2147483647'

       Show the time on the west coast of the US (use tzselect(1) to find TZ)

              $ TZ='America/Los_Angeles' date

       Show the local time for 9AM next Friday on the west coast of the US

              $ date --date='TZ="America/Los_Angeles" 09:00 next Fri'

DATE STRING
       The  --date=STRING  is  a mostly free format human readable date string
       such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004 16:21:42 -0800" or "2004-02-29  16:21:42"  or
       even  "next Thursday".  A date string may contain items indicating cal‐
       endar date, time of day, time zone, day of week, relative  time,  rela‐
       tive date, and numbers.  An empty string indicates the beginning of the
       day.  The date string format is more complex than is easily  documented
       here but is fully described in the info documentation.

CAL(1)                    BSD General Commands Manual                   CAL(1)

NAME
     cal, ncal — displays a calendar and the date of Easter

SYNOPSIS
     cal [-3hjy] [-A number] [-B number] [[month] year]
     cal [-3hj] [-A number] [-B number] -m month [year]
     ncal [-3bhjJpwySM] [-A number] [-B number] [-s country_code] [[month]
         year]
     ncal [-3bhJeoSM] [-A number] [-B number] [year]
     ncal [-CN] [-H yyyy-mm-dd] [-d yyyy-mm]

DESCRIPTION
     The cal utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format and ncal
     offers an alternative layout, more options and the date of Easter.  The
     new format is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25x80 termi‐
     nal.  If arguments are not specified, the current month is displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     -h      Turns off highlighting of today.

     -J      Display Julian Calendar, if combined with the -o option, display
             date of Orthodox Easter according to the Julian Calendar.

     -e      Display date of Easter (for western churches).

     -j      Display Julian days (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

     -m month
             Display the specified month.  If month is specified as a decimal
             number, it may be followed by the letter ‘f’ or ‘p’ to indicate
             the following or preceding month of that number, respectively.

     -o      Display date of Orthodox Easter (Greek and Russian Orthodox
             Churches).

     -p      Print the country codes and switching days from Julian to Grego‐
             rian Calendar as they are assumed by ncal.  The country code as
             determined from the local environment is marked with an asterisk.

     -s country_code
             Assume the switch from Julian to Gregorian Calendar at the date
             associated with the country_code.  If not specified, ncal tries
             to guess the switch date from the local environment or falls back
             to September 2, 1752.  This was when Great Britain and her
             colonies switched to the Gregorian Calendar.

     -w      Print the number of the week below each week column.

     -y      Display a calendar for the specified year. This option is implied
             when a year but no month are specified on the command line.

     -3      Display the previous, current and next month surrounding today.

     -1      Display only the current month. This is the default.

     -A number
             Months to add after. The specified number of months is added to
             the end of the display. This is in addition to any date range
             selected by the -y, -3, or -1 options. For example, “cal -y -B2
             -A2” shows everything from November of the previous year to Feb‐
             ruary of the following year. Negative numbers are allowed, in
             which case the specified number of months is subtracted. For
             example, “cal -y -B-6” shows July to December. And “cal -A11”
             simply shows the next 12 months.

     -B number
             Months to add before. The specified number of months is added to
             the beginning of the display. See -A for examples.

     -C      Switch to cal mode.

     -N      Switch to ncal mode.

     -d yyyy-mm
             Use yyyy-mm as the current date (for debugging of date selec‐
             tion).

     -H yyyy-mm-dd
             Use yyyy-mm-dd as the current date (for debugging of highlight‐
             ing).

     -M      Weeks start on Monday.

     -S      Weeks start on Sunday.

     -b      Use oldstyle format for ncal output.

     A single parameter specifies the year (1–9999) to be displayed; note the
     year must be fully specified: “cal 89” will not display a calendar for
     1989.  Two parameters denote the month and year; the month is either a
     number between 1 and 12, or a full or abbreviated name as specified by
     the current locale.  Month and year default to those of the current sys‐
     tem clock and time zone (so “cal -m 8” will display a calendar for the
     month of August in the current year).

     Not all options can be used together. For example, the options -y, -3,
     and -1 are mutually exclusive. If inconsistent options are given, the
     later ones take precedence over the earlier ones.

     A year starts on January 1.

HISTORY
     A cal command appeared in Version 5 AT&T UNIX.  The ncal command appeared
     in FreeBSD 2.2.6.  The output of the cal command is supposed to be bit
     for bit compatible to the original Unix cal command, because its output
     is processed by other programs like CGI scripts, that should not be bro‐
     ken. Therefore it will always output 8 lines, even if only 7 contain
     data. This extra blank line also appears with the original cal command,
     at least on Solaris 8

AUTHORS
     The ncal command and manual were written by Wolfgang Helbig
     <helbig@FreeBSD.org>.

BUGS
     The assignment of Julian–Gregorian switching dates to country codes is
     historically naive for many countries.

     Not all options are compatible and using them in different orders will
     give varying results.

TOUCH(1)                         User Commands                        TOUCH(1)



NAME
       touch - change file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
       touch [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Update  the  access  and modification times of each FILE to the current
       time.

       A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c  or  -h
       is supplied.

       A  FILE  argument  string of - is handled specially and causes touch to
       change the times of the file associated with standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are  mandatory  for  short  options
       too.

       -a     change only the access time

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -d, --date=STRING
              parse STRING and use it instead of current time

       -f     (ignored)

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced file (useful
              only on systems that can change the timestamps of a symlink)

       -m     change only the modification time

       -r, --reference=FILE
              use this file's times instead of current time

       -t STAMP
              use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time

       --time=WORD
              change the specified time: WORD is access, atime, or use: equiv‐
              alent to -a WORD is modify or mtime: equivalent to -m

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Note that the -d and -t options accept different time-date formats.

DATE STRING
       The  --date=STRING  is  a mostly free format human readable date string
       such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004 16:21:42 -0800" or "2004-02-29  16:21:42"  or
       even  "next Thursday".  A date string may contain items indicating cal‐
       endar date, time of day, time zone, day of week, relative  time,  rela‐
       tive date, and numbers.  An empty string indicates the beginning of the
       day.  The date string format is more complex than is easily  documented
       here but is fully described in the info documentation.

NAME
       date - print or set the system date and time

SYNOPSIS
       date [OPTION]... [+FORMAT]
       date [-u|--utc|--universal] [MMDDhhmm[[CC]YY][.ss]]

DESCRIPTION
       Display the current time in the given FORMAT, or set the system date.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -d, --date=STRING
              display time described by STRING, not 'now'

       -f, --file=DATEFILE
              like --date once for each line of DATEFILE

       -I[TIMESPEC], --iso-8601[=TIMESPEC]
              output date/time in ISO 8601 format.  TIMESPEC='date' for date only (the default), 'hours', 'minutes', 'seconds', or
              'ns' for date and time to the indicated precision.

       -r, --reference=FILE
              display the last modification time of FILE

       -R, --rfc-2822
              output date and time in RFC 2822 format.  Example: Mon, 07 Aug 2006 12:34:56 -0600

       --rfc-3339=TIMESPEC
              output date and time in RFC 3339 format.  TIMESPEC='date', 'seconds', or 'ns' for date and  time  to  the  indicated
              precision.  Date and time components are separated by a single space: 2006-08-07 12:34:56-06:00

       -s, --set=STRING
              set time described by STRING

       -u, --utc, --universal
              print or set Coordinated Universal Time

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       FORMAT controls the output.  Interpreted sequences are:

       %%     a literal %

       %a     locale's abbreviated weekday name (e.g., Sun)

       %A     locale's full weekday name (e.g., Sunday)

       %B     locale's full month name (e.g., January)

       %c     locale's date and time (e.g., Thu Mar  3 23:05:25 2005)

       %C     century; like %Y, except omit last two digits (e.g., 20)

       %k     hour, space padded ( 0..23); same as %_H

       %l     hour, space padded ( 1..12); same as %_I

       %m     month (01..12)

       %M     minute (00..59)

       %n     a newline

       %N     nanoseconds (000000000..999999999)

       %P     like %p, but lower case

       %r     locale's 12-hour clock time (e.g., 11:11:04 PM)

       %R     24-hour hour and minute; same as %H:%M

       %s     seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC

       %S     second (00..60)

       %t     a tab

       %T     time; same as %H:%M:%S

       %u     day of week (1..7); 1 is Monday

       %U     week number of year, with Sunday as first day of week (00..53)

       %V     ISO week number, with Monday as first day of week (01..53)

       %w     day of week (0..6); 0 is Sunday

       %W     week number of year, with Monday as first day of week (00..53)

       %x     locale's date representation (e.g., 12/31/99)

       %X     locale's time representation (e.g., 23:13:48)

       %:z    +hh:mm numeric time zone (e.g., -04:00)

       %::z   +hh:mm:ss numeric time zone (e.g., -04:00:00)

       %:::z  numeric time zone with : to necessary precision (e.g., -04, +05:30)

       %Z     alphabetic time zone abbreviation (e.g., EDT)

       By default, date pads numeric fields with zeroes.  The following optional flags may follow '%':

       -      (hyphen) do not pad the field

       _      (underscore) pad with spaces

       0      (zero) pad with zeros

       ^      use upper case if possible

       #      use opposite case if possible

       After any flags comes an optional field width, as a decimal number; then an optional modifier, which is either E to use the
       locale's alternate representations if available, or O to use the locale's alternate numeric symbols if available.

EXAMPLES
       Convert seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 UTC) to a date

              $ date --date='@2147483647'

       Show the time on the west coast of the US (use tzselect(1) to find TZ)

              $ TZ='America/Los_Angeles' date

       Show the local time for 9AM next Friday on the west coast of the US

              $ date --date='TZ="America/Los_Angeles" 09:00 next Fri'

DATE STRING
       The --date=STRING is a mostly free format human readable date  string  such  as  "Sun,  29  Feb  2004  16:21:42  -0800"  or
       "2004-02-29 16:21:42" or even "next Thursday".  A date string may contain items indicating calendar date, time of day, time
       zone, day of week, relative time, relative date, and numbers.  An empty string indicates the beginning  of  the  day.   The
       date string format is more complex than is easily documented here but is fully described in the info documentation.

NAME
     cal, ncal — displays a calendar and the date of Easter

SYNOPSIS
     cal [-3hjy] [-A number] [-B number] [[month] year]
     cal [-3hj] [-A number] [-B number] -m month [year]
     ncal [-3bhjJpwySM] [-A number] [-B number] [-s country_code] [[month] year]
     ncal [-3bhJeoSM] [-A number] [-B number] [year]
     ncal [-CN] [-H yyyy-mm-dd] [-d yyyy-mm]

DESCRIPTION
     The cal utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format and ncal offers an alternative layout, more options and the
     date of Easter.  The new format is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25x80 terminal.  If arguments are not speci‐
     fied, the current month is displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     -h      Turns off highlighting of today.

     -J      Display Julian Calendar, if combined with the -o option, display date of Orthodox Easter according to the Julian Cal‐
             endar.

     -e      Display date of Easter (for western churches).

     -j      Display Julian days (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

     -m month
             Display the specified month.  If month is specified as a decimal number, it may be followed by the letter ‘f’ or ‘p’
             to indicate the following or preceding month of that number, respectively.

     -o      Display date of Orthodox Easter (Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches).

     -p      Print the country codes and switching days from Julian to Gregorian Calendar as they are assumed by ncal.  The coun‐
             try code as determined from the local environment is marked with an asterisk.

     -s country_code
             Assume the switch from Julian to Gregorian Calendar at the date associated with the country_code.  If not specified,
             ncal tries to guess the switch date from the local environment or falls back to September 2, 1752.  This was when
             Great Britain and her colonies switched to the Gregorian Calendar.

     -w      Print the number of the week below each week column.

     -y      Display a calendar for the specified year. This option is implied when a year but no month are specified on the com‐
             mand line.

     -3      Display the previous, current and next month surrounding today.

     -1      Display only the current month. This is the default.

     -A number
             Months to add after. The specified number of months is added to the end of the display. This is in addition to any
             date range selected by the -y, -3, or -1 options. For example, “cal -y -B2 -A2” shows everything from November of the
             previous year to February of the following year. Negative numbers are allowed, in which case the specified number of
             months is subtracted. For example, “cal -y -B-6” shows July to December. And “cal -A11” simply shows the next 12
             months.

     -B number
             Months to add before. The specified number of months is added to the beginning of the display. See -A for examples.

     -C      Switch to cal mode.

     -N      Switch to ncal mode.

     -d yyyy-mm
             Use yyyy-mm as the current date (for debugging of date selection).

     -H yyyy-mm-dd
             Use yyyy-mm-dd as the current date (for debugging of highlighting).

     -M      Weeks start on Monday.

     -S      Weeks start on Sunday.

     -b      Use oldstyle format for ncal output.

     A single parameter specifies the year (1–9999) to be displayed; note the year must be fully specified: “cal 89” will not dis‐
     play a calendar for 1989.  Two parameters denote the month and year; the month is either a number between 1 and 12, or a full
     or abbreviated name as specified by the current locale.  Month and year default to those of the current system clock and time
     zone (so “cal -m 8” will display a calendar for the month of August in the current year).

     Not all options can be used together. For example, the options -y, -3, and -1 are mutually exclusive. If inconsistent options
     are given, the later ones take precedence over the earlier ones.

     A year starts on January 1.

HISTORY
     A cal command appeared in Version 5 AT&T UNIX.  The ncal command appeared in FreeBSD 2.2.6.  The output of the cal command is
     supposed to be bit for bit compatible to the original Unix cal command, because its output is processed by other programs
     like CGI scripts, that should not be broken. Therefore it will always output 8 lines, even if only 7 contain data. This extra
     blank line also appears with the original cal command, at least on Solaris 8

AUTHORS
     The ncal command and manual were written by Wolfgang Helbig <helbig@FreeBSD.org>.

BUGS
     The assignment of Julian–Gregorian switching dates to country codes is historically naive for many countries.

     Not all options are compatible and using them in different orders will give varying results.

NAME
       touch - change file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
       touch [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time.

       A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c or -h is supplied.

       A  FILE argument string of - is handled specially and causes touch to change the times of the file associated with standard
       output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a     change only the access time

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -d, --date=STRING
              parse STRING and use it instead of current time

       -f     (ignored)

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced file (useful only on systems that can change the timestamps of a
              symlink)

       -m     change only the modification time

       -r, --reference=FILE
              use this file's times instead of current time

       -t STAMP
              use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time

       --time=WORD
              change the specified time: WORD is access, atime, or use: equivalent to -a WORD is modify or mtime: equivalent to -m

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Note that the -d and -t options accept different time-date formats.

DATE STRING
       The  --date=STRING  is  a  mostly  free  format  human  readable  date  string such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004 16:21:42 -0800" or
       "2004-02-29 16:21:42" or even "next Thursday".  A date string may contain items indicating calendar date, time of day, time
       zone,  day  of  week,  relative time, relative date, and numbers.  An empty string indicates the beginning of the day.  The
       date string format is more complex than is easily documented here but is fully described in the info documentation.
