Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay and you're okay 
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four star daydream 
Think I'll buy me a football team

Money, get back
I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit 
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class traveling set 
And I think I need a Lear jet

Money, it's a crime 
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say 
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for payrise it's no surprise
That they're giving none away
Away, away, way
Away, away, away
